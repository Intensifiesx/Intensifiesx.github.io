# Zain's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. The website is built using **React** and styled with custom CSS.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website is designed to present my professional background, including a brief introduction, a list of my projects, and a way to contact me. It features an interactive background, smooth animations, and a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
